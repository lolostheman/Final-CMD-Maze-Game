This program has a headerfile an implementation file and a main file.
the code prints out 1 map at a time, and allows the user to beat the map
aka finish the maze. Once the maze is finsished the program prints out the
next map, and moves the player to the start of that map. once the player has
hit the same array element where a "C" or "O" is located it either 
increments the coin count by 1 or proceeds to the next level. C is for coin
and P is for next level. Lastly Right after you enter your name, the timer starts
and doesnt pause or finish untill u beat the last maze. We incorporated
the "chrono" library to be able to run a clock for this.
